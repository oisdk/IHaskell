    "* It parameterizes the notion of a \"model\": for compression, this allows intelligent prediction of things like \"a u is likely to come after a q\" (when compressing English text). Commonly, it facilitates the building of a frequency table on the fly. For our purposes, it will both build the frequency table on-the-fly, and potentially allow us to cluster similar data together.\n",

    "Finally, we will decompress as we compress, translating the intervals back into the values of the domain we are anonymizing.

     "abstract": "Publishing data about individuals without revealing sensitive information about them is an important problem. In recent years, a new definition of privacy called kappa-anonymity has gained popularity. In a kappa-anonymized dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k—1 other records with respect to certain \"identifying\" attributes. In this paper we show with two simple attacks that a kappa-anonymized dataset has some subtle, but severe privacy problems. First, we show that an attacker can discover the values of sensitive attributes when there is little diversity in those sensitive attributes. Second, attackers often have background knowledge, and we show that kappa-anonymity does not guarantee privacy against attackers using background knowledge. We give a detailed analysis of these two attacks and we propose a novel and powerful privacy definition called ell-diversity. In addition to building a formal foundation for ell-diversity, we show in an experimental evaluation that ell-diversity is practical and can be implemented efficiently.",

All existing methods achieving k-anonymity assume implicitly that the data objects to be anonymized are given once and fixed. However, in many applications, the real world data sources are dynamic. In this paper, we investigate the problem of maintaining k-anonymity against incremental updates, and propose a simple yet effective solution. We analyze how inferences from multiple releases may temper the k-anonymity of data, and propose the monotonic incremental anonymization property. The general idea is to progressively and consistently reduce the generalization granularity as incremental updates arrive. Our new approach guarantees the k-anonymity on each release, and also on the inferred table using multiple releases. At the same time, our new approach utilizes the more and more accumulated data to reduce the information loss.",

     "abstract": "Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named k-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides k-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The k-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, µ-Argus and k-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.",
